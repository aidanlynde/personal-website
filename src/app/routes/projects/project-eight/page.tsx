          <p>
            As part of the Econ 491 course at UIUC, I had the incredible opportunity to delve deep into the field of machine learning, tackling complex problems with real-world data. The course, taught by Professor Marcelo C. Medeiros, was unlike any traditional class I had taken. Professor Medeiros, a pioneer in neural network research breakthroughs in the 90s and early 2000s, brought a wealth of experience and knowledge to the course. His mentorship was instrumental in guiding my journey into machine learning, where he encouraged us to explore beyond the basics and tackle advanced algorithms and models.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Throughout the semester, I worked on a series of machine learning projects that challenged me to build predictive models, experiment with neural networks, and implement algorithms like k-means clustering for unsupervised learning tasks. One of the key takeaways from the course was understanding how to apply neural networks to model complex, nonlinear relationships in the data, as well as using clustering methods to identify patterns and segment data. These projects not only deepened my technical understanding but also developed my ability to think creatively about data collection, feature engineering, and model optimization.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What made this course especially transformative was Professor Medeiros' approach to teaching. The class felt like a semester of independent study, where he provided us with the foundational tools, but allowed the freedom to take our own direction with data collection and application. This autonomy fostered a deep engagement with the material, encouraging me to learn machine learning concepts beyond the classroom, and empowering me to apply these techniques to solve real-world problems. I credit a significant part of my interest in machine learning and my ability to quickly grasp new concepts to the flexibility and insight I gained from this class.
